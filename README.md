Overview
---

In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. There are some advanced computer vision methods will be implemented in this project, such as camera calibration, gradients thresholding, color space converting thresholding, perspective transform, etc.
